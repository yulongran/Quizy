#### The problem and solution

The majority of the students are relying on textbooks and class notes for studying exams. The absence of a dynamic study tool limits the performance of the students on the exam.


Quizy is a web-based application that allows users to engage in learning in a unique and fun way. The application provides a platform for students and instructors to create study quiz sets. With Quilzy, the student can study their exam more efficiently and responsively.


#### System Requirement

* The application uses React framework for font-end developement.
* Express + NodeJS for backend developement.

* The application uses MongoDB as application database.


#### Reasoning architectural choices

* React is one of the most popular frameworks and makes the development process easier.

* React uses Component-based architecture, which allows the developer to reuse components and increases the scalability of the application.

* NodeJS also uses Javascript which makes the development process faster.

* MongoDB is a NoSQL database program. The Quiz information is more suited to NoSQl database compare to the SQL tables.

#### Trade Offs

* The target development time is one week; therefore, I choose the most familiar frameworks.

* The UI uses the Material-UI compoents.

* Lack of time for unit testing.


#### Possible Improvement

* Perform Unit-Testing
* Uses Django for backend services.
* Comes up with my own UI components rather using Material-UI.
* Break large components into small components to improve readbility and scability.
